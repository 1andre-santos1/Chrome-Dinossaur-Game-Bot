## About

The objective of this application was the creation of a bot that can play, without human interaction, the Chrome offline game.

## How To Run

In this repository there's a compressed rar, named 'app', that contains the executable to run the application. When clicked, a console pops up with an option to select if you want the object detection window or not. If this option is selected, you can see on a different window the object detection in action.
